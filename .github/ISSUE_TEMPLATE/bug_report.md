**What does the bug look like?**

<!-- When in doubt, share a screenshot showing exactly what the bug looks like when it happens. There are often surprising clues elsewhere in the IDE! -->

**What did you expect to happen?**

<!-- Seems like a problem is actually just something working as designed rather than as expected. -->

**What problem are you trying to solve?**

<!-- It's often helpful to describe the larger task you were trying to accomplish. Sometimes what looks like a bug is actually just a symptom of trying to put a round peg in a square hole. -->
